# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis
Pyber is a mobility as a service provider, allowing users to book a car and a driver to transport them in a way similar to a taxi.

After running an analysis based on data obtained from rides among different type of cities (Urban, Suburban and Rural). The main takeaway found was a visible disparity between the fares for each ride. To address this issue and to derive insights and obtained suggested measures to take.

## Results
We have two datasets to work with. The first dataset gives us the driver count and type of city of several cities where PyBer provides services. The second dataset provides more detailed information of specific rides, through this dataset we can easily analyze the fluctuations of fares for every city type.

To be able to use this information, we are going to first merge both dataset to use them in conjunction.

To visualize the disparity noticed, we are going to use three main comparisons.
- **Total Rides by City Type**
- **Total Drivers by city Type**
- **Total Fares by City Type**

### Total Rides by City Type
What we notice here is the expected, urbanized cities get a considerably higher amount of rides than suburban or rural cities.

This is of course translated to more job opportunities for each driver that register to provide services with PyBer and generally speaking the more rides generated, the more revenues obtained.

Nevertheless as any other product or service in the market, the value is determined by the law of supply and demand.

>*The law of supply states that the quantity of a good supplied (i.e., the amount owners or producers offer for sale) rises as the market price rises, and falls as the price falls. Conversely, the law of demand says that the quantity of a good demanded falls as the price rises, and vice versa.*

Taking into account this principle, we can assume that the fares are going to decrease the more drivers we have.

### Total Drivers by City Type
